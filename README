uglyPharmaParser: Generate open drug data
-----------------------------------------

German law demands that all drugs prescribed in the country in must carry an uniqe identification code (PZN or "Pharmazentralnummer") for identification of active ingredients, manufacturer and dosage ( SGB V § 300 ).

You think this information should be open data...but it isn't.

Actually you have to pay €€€ for registration of drugs (what is OK) AND the usage of the database (what is absolutely not OK).
Remember... this information is actually REQUIRED by federal law.

So this tool generates an open pharma database in the form of a structured XML file - from free public available sources.
